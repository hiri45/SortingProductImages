- I created this program to essentially make a job easier than it had to be. Initially using excel and manually trying to allocate images in a certain folder
in relation to a specific product was hard and tedious

- For this task I had to take into account the URL which is provided by shopify. Using that I create a folder and name it a specific code which is represented in the URL.
this code is relevant to a specific product and the images behind it. For example there may be a football in a certain brand consisting of multiple images. If a folder isn't already created
it is created and the images are downloaded and added into it.

- The image_transfer.py represents how the program works with dummy data represented by amazon_image.csv and msa_image.csv which I was using at the time
